    <div>
      I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href = "https://www.pstat.ucsb.edu">Department of Statistics and Applied Probability</a> at <a href = "https://www.ucsb.edu">University of California, Santa Barbara</a>.
      I enjoy thinking about statistical learning problems from both theoretical and computational perspectives. I am broadly interested in high-dimensional statistics and multiple testing problems.
      <br>
      <br>
      Previously, I was a post-doctoral research associate in the <a href = "http://www.stat.washington.edu/">Department of Statistics</a> at the University of Washington, working with <a href = "https://faculty.washington.edu/dwitten/">Daniela Witten</a> at University of Washington, and <a href = "http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~jbien/">Jacob Bien</a> at University of Southern California. 
      <br>
      <br>
      I received my Ph.D. in statistics in 2018 from Cornell University under the supervision of <a href = "http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~jbien/">Jacob Bien</a>.
